🌦️ Weather Prediction System

An AI-powered weather prediction system using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to forecast weather conditions based on environmental factors such as temperature,
humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The model achieves 85% accuracy on both training and testing datasets and is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

📌 Features

✔️ Predicts weather conditions (☁️ Cloudy, ☀️ Sunny, 🌧️ Rainy, ❄️ Snowy)

✔️ Uses SVC model trained on real-world weather data

✔️ Interactive web interface built with Streamlit

✔️ Accepts user input for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation

✔️ Provides instant weather condition predictions

⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ User Input: The user provides weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and season.

2️⃣ Data Processing: The inputs are preprocessed and encoded to match the trained model’s format.

3️⃣ Prediction: The trained SVC model analyzes the input and predicts the most probable weather condition.

4️⃣ Result Display: The predicted weather condition (☀️, ☁️, 🌧️, ❄️) is shown on the Streamlit web interface.
